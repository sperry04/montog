# This example configuration file assumes a 3-monitor system with monitors 
# at ID's DP-0, DP-2, and DP-3 in that order, naming them with the aliases 
# "left", "center", and "right".
#
# It provides 5 arrangements for various 1, 2 or 3 enabled monitors, 
# preferring the center or left monitors as primary.  
#
# To use this configuration file, put it in ~/.config/montog-config.yaml and
# edit the monitors block to match the IDs show in the About dialog, paying 
# attention to match the IDs with the positional alias names (left/center/right).
#
# Emojis are used in the arrangement labels as iconography to make the menu
# clearer when switching active monitors.

# monitor aliases
#   maps alias name to monitor ID and any additional
#   xrandr options required by the monitor
